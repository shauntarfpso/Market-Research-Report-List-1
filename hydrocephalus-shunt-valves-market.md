<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunt Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Pressure</li><li>Monopressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrocephalus shunt valves market comprises two primary types: adjustable pressure and monopressure valves. Adjustable pressure valves allow for personalized cerebrospinal fluid drainage by enabling clinicians to modify the pressure settings based on patient needs, enhancing treatment effectiveness. In contrast, monopressure valves maintain a fixed pressure, providing consistent drainage but limiting customization. Both types play crucial roles in managing hydrocephalus, with choices depending on patient condition, required flexibility, and therapeutic objectives in cerebrospinal fluid management.</p></p>
